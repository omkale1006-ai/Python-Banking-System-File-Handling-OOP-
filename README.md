🏦 Python Banking System (Self-Built Project)
📌 About the Project

This is a console-based Banking System built using Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and File Handling.
The project simulates real-world banking operations such as account management, secure PIN-based authentication, transaction handling, and ATM card functionality.

👉 This is a self-built project, designed to strengthen my understanding of Python logic, file handling, and real-world system design.
No tutorial was copied — the logic was implemented step by step through practice and experimentation.

🚀 Features

🎯 Learning Outcome
Through this project, I learned:
How real banking workflows operate internally
How to design structured programs using OOP
How to manage data permanently using files
How to break a large problem into smaller modules
🔮 Future Improvements
GUI using Tkinter
Admin panel
PIN encryption
Interest calculation
Database integration (SQLite / MySQL)
Improved validation and error handling
🙌 Conclusion
This project represents my hands-on learning journey in Python.
It reflects logical thinking, clean structure, and practical implementation of concepts rather than tutorial-based copying.
